# FreeCodeCamp: Learn CSS Variables by Building a City Skyline

This repository contains my completed project for the **FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification**. The project focuses on **CSS Variables** by building a city skyline.

## Project Overview

The "City Skyline" project is a part of FreeCodeCamp's curriculum designed to teach the use of **CSS variables**. The goal is to create a visually appealing skyline using CSS and HTML while understanding how to define, use, and manipulate CSS variables.

### Key Features:

- Use of custom properties (CSS variables) for reusability and maintainability.
- Dynamic theming with CSS variables.
- Hands-on practice with layout techniques, including `position`, `z-index`, and flexbox.

### What I Learned:

- Defining and using CSS variables with the `--` syntax.
- Understanding the `var()` function to apply variables.
- How CSS variables can make styling consistent and flexible.
- Structuring and organizing CSS for complex layouts.
